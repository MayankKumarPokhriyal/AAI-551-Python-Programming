# Description: This program computes the slope of a line given
# the end points of the line. The result is then printed to the screen.

# Initialize the end points.
startX = -2
startY = 1
endX = 5
endY = 36

# Compute the slope.
slope = (startY - endY) / (startX - endX) #Logic Error:formula and Syntax Errors:parenthesis

# Print the results.
print("Starting point: (",startX,",",startY,")") #formatting error: missing commas
print("Ending point: (",endX,",",endY,")")
print("Slope of the line =", slope) #formatting error: missing inverted coma and capital S in slope
